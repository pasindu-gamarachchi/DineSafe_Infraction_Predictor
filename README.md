# DineSafe Infraction Predictor
Machine Learning Algorithms predict the outcomes of health inspections for businesses in Toronto.

# Abstract

  Health code violation can result in fines exceeding $1000, and can damage the image of an establishment. 
Information regarding violations are easily available to potential customers through social media and local blogs such as [blogTO](https://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2018/09/toronto-dinesafe-tim-hortons-wing-machine-3-brewers-big-smoke-burger/). 
The DineSafe Predictive Model uses Yelp reviews, and relevant business data to predict the outcome of an establishmentâ€™s 
next inspection. Using the prediction, establishments can make the necessary adjustments to prevent infractions. Firstly, the model 
predicts whether a violation will occur for a given inspection, then an independent model predicts the type of prediction. The results
of the model are shown below.
