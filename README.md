# DineSafe Infraction Predictor
Machine Learning Algorithms predict the outcomes of health inspections for businesses in Toronto.

# Abstract

Health code violation can result in fines exceeding $1000, and can damage the image of an establishment. 
Information regarding violations are easily available to potential customers through social media and local blogs such as [blogTO](https://www.blogto.com/). 
The DineSafe Predictive Model uses Yelp reviews, and relevant business data to predict the outcome of an establishmentâ€™s 
next inspection. Using the prediction, establishments can make the necessary adjustments to prevent infractions.
